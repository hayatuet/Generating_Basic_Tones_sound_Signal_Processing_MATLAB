# Generating Basic Tones Sound Signal Processing MATLAB:
This project is about generation of tone signals of cosine, sawtooth &amp; square waves, and saving them. The aim of this project was to listen &amp; store different basic sound wave, and it is all about hearing to the Fourier Series.
for more details kindly see the PDF, m files and listen to the sound files generated.
